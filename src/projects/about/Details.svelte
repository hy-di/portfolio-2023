		Due to my fundamental interest in physics and technical design, 
		I have already gained experiences and acquired knowledge 
		about the manufacture of products. During my bachelor's degree in 
		integrated product design, I started working in a small agency, which 
		not only gave me the opportunity to not only get to know the most 
		important software programs, but also to build my skills offsite the 
		digital world in the in-house workshop.

		My speciality is parametric design of technical products, but I 
		want to develop my other skills or even develop new ones. So I 
		thought it was time for a new adventure in the industrial design 
		universe and became a freelancer while starting a master program 
		at the beginning of 2024.
