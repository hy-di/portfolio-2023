	<p>
		Due to my fundamental interest in physics and technical design, 
		my first professional experience led me to OXXID, a small design agency in Munich. 
		Already during my bachelor's degree in integrated product design, 
		I started working there, which gave me the opportunity to not only get to know essential software, 
		but could also test my skills offsite the digital world in the in-house workshop.

		My current specialty is in parametric design of technical products, 
		but I would like to further develop my other skills or even create new ones. 
		Thatâ€™s why after 1,5 years at OXXID it is time for a new adventure in the industrial design universe.
